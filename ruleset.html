	<p>In case something goes wrong, feel free to contact our <strong>tournament staff</strong>. Here’s a guide on how to find and contact them. Try not to contact them in any other way, as this might lead to confusion. Conversations between the staff and players are <strong>confidential</strong> and must not be posted or shared publicly without proper consent.</p>
	<br>
	<h3 class="anchor" id="6.1">6.1 Challengermode Chat</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Go to the tournament’s official Challengermode site</li>
		<li>Look through the Admin list and find an Admin/Mod that is listed as online (green dot underneath their profile picture)</li>

	</ul>
	<br>
	
	<h2 class="anchor" id="7">7. Statistics Reporting</h2>
	<p>When you’re finished with your match, it’s crucial to report the correct scores and confirm the results with your opposing team.</p>
	<br>
	<h3 class="anchor" id="7.1">7.1 Evidence</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>In order to achieve transparent documentation of the results, every player (especially the team captains) have to screenshot the game results. <span>Be aware that if you do not create a screenshot, you cannot prove your claims!</span></li>
		<li>If no team recorded evidence, one team captain may propose a result: This result must then be verified by the opposing team captain</li>
	</ul>
	<br>

	<h2 class="anchor" id="8">8. Match Interruptions</h2>
	<p>Sometimes a game can have unforeseen consequences, where both teams can’t really do anything against it. This can be frustrating, but shouldn’t be too big of an obstacle in your way. Make sure to think of these rules, when something unexpected happens. If uncertainty arises, contact the tournament staff.</p>
	<br>
	<h3 class="anchor" id="8.1">8.1 Unintentional Interruptions</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>For example: Disconnections, game crashes & spontaneous connection issues</li>
		<li>The game will be <strong>continued</strong> (e.g. if one player disconnects during a 3v3 match, the game will be carried through as an 2v3 match)</li>
		<li>If such interruptions happen in the very first game of your match and both teams agree, the current game can be <strong>restarted<a href="#ref" data-balloon-length="medium" aria-label="Make sure to communicate promptly and clearly to your opposing team" data-balloon-pos="up"><sup>9</sup></a></strong></li>
		<li>The disconnected player is <strong>allowed</strong> to try to <strong>reconnect</strong>, but cannot be substituted by another player (specified sub, external player)</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<h3 class="anchor" id="8.2">8.2 Intentional Interruptions</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>For example: Rage quits & disqualifications</li>
		<li>The game will be <strong>continued</strong> (e.g. if one player quits during a 3v3 match, the game will be carried through as an 2v3 match)</li>
		<li>The disconnected player is <strong>not allowed</strong> to try to <strong>reconnect</strong> and cannot be substituted by another player (specified sub, external player)</li>
	</ul>
	<br>

	<h2 class="anchor" id="9">9. Sanctioning</h2>
	<p>We’re in for good and fair games. If someone doesn’t obey the rules, insults other players in an arbitrary way or uses malicious third-party software, consequences will be carried through. In each case, whatever the tournament staff decides must be respected and cannot be challenged.</p>
	<br>
	<h3 class="anchor" id="9.1">9.1 Verbal Abuse & Harassment</h3>
	<p>Engaging in competitive sports can be frustrating at times, but we want everyone to enjoy our tournaments. People that harm other people in any defamatory way and/or do not obey the code of conduct (<a href="#1.3">1.3</a>) must expect strict consequences.</p>
	<br>
	<h3 class="anchor" id="9.2">9.2 No Show Policy</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>After your match bracket is generated by Challengermode, one team (<a href="#5.1">5.1</a>) has to create a lobby <strong>within 10 minutes</strong> of the bracket generation and the opposing team has to join <strong>within 10 minutes</strong> of the lobby creation</li>
		<li>If this doesn’t happen, please <strong>report your situation</strong> to the tournament staff (<a href="#6">6</a>)</li>
		<li>If there’s <strong>no sign<a href="#ref" data-balloon-length="medium" aria-label="No conversations inside Discord, no response to Challengermode chat messages or pings" data-balloon-pos="up"><sup>10</sup></a> from both teams</strong>, the tournament staff reserves the right to kick each team from the tournament</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<h3 class="anchor" id="9.3">9.3 Cheating / Hacking</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>You’re <strong>not allowed</strong> to use any additional software/hardware, such as rigged controllers, malicious third-party software, etc.</li>
		<li>You are <strong>not allowed</strong> to abuse glitches and/or bugs</li>
		<li>If you witness any of the above described behaviours, please <strong>record evidence</strong> (in form of video footage, screenshots, etc.) of this person and inform the tournament staff after finishing your match (<a href="#6">6</a>)</li>
		<li>The current bracket will be <strong>halted</strong> in the case of an active report</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<h3 class="anchor" id="9.4">9.4 Discord Bans & Brawl Disqualifications</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>There are multiple ways for <strong>individuals</strong> to get disqualified from the <span>HUB BRAWL</span> (the staff decides the severity in each case): <ul>
			<li>Being disqualified from the ongoing tournament</li>
			<li>Being permanently banned from taking part in any future HUB BRAWLS</li>
			<li>Being kicked or banned from the <strong>KC League Discord server<a href="#ref" data-balloon-length="medium" aria-label="Not being part of the KC League Discord server simultaneously results in a disqualification from all HUB BRAWLS: See Requirements (1.1)" data-balloon-pos="up"><sup>11</sup></a></strong></li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>Further, there are consequences that can be carried out against a <strong>whole team</strong>:<ul>
			<li>Being disqualified from the ongoing tournament</li>
			<li>Being permanently banned from taking part in any future HUB BRAWLS</li>
		</ul></li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<h3 class="anchor" id="9.5">9.5 Consequences for other teams</h3>
	<ul><li>If a team gets kicked from an ongoing tournament, the following rules will apply: <ul>
		<li>The current or next opposing team gets a free win</li>
		<li>The previously reported match scores involving this team will remain the same</li>
	</ul></li>
	</ul>
